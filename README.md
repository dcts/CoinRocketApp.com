The app is in the making. Its a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker that does not require you to download an app or to create an accout, simply track your crypto portfolio by submitting your holdings on the landing page, which will then generate a link for you where you can directly see your portfolio! No download, no registration, fast loadtimes!
- landing page is still in the making
- crypto portfolio tracker is working, but the holdings have to be entered in the URL as params! So for example, if you want to track `3 BTC` and `15 ETH`, just append `?BTC=3&ETH=15` to the following base URL: `http://CoinRocketApp.com/`. 
- [example 1:](http://CoinRocketApp.com/?BTC=1&ETH=12&XMR=20&MIOTA=1000) `http://CoinRocketApp.com/?BTC=1&ETH=12&XMR=20&MIOTA=1000`
- [example 2:](http://CoinRocketApp.com/?BTC=1&HOT=1000000&NANO=1000&NEO=50) `http://CoinRocketApp.com/?BTC=1&HOT=1000000&NANO=1000&NEO=50`
- [example 3 (list all coins)](http://CoinRocketApp.com/): `http://CoinRocketApp.com/`
